# Demographic Transition and the Overpopulation Myth

This project explores one of the most persistent misconceptions in global development: **"Will saving poor children lead to overpopulation?"**

Using sixty years of demographic data from the Gapminder Foundation (1960-2020) covering 195 countries, this interactive visualization reveals the counterintuitive truth about population dynamics. Rather than causing population explosions, reducing child mortality actually leads to smaller families and population stabilization.

The analysis demonstrates the **demographic transition**—a predictable pattern where countries move from high mortality/high fertility to low mortality/low fertility as they develop economically. Through animated visualizations and exploratory data analysis, users can observe how saving children's lives is not the cause of overpopulation, but rather the prerequisite for achieving replacement-level fertility.

The project examines the key mechanisms driving this transition: economic development enabling, female education transforming family planning decisions, and urbanization restructuring incentives around family size. Regional projections to 2100 show all world regions converging toward approximately 2.1 children per woman—the replacement level necessary for population stability.

The evidence indicates: reducing child mortality is the pathway to population stability, not its obstacle. The fear of overpopulation represents a fundamental misunderstanding of demographic processes and should not influence development policy formulation.
